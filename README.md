# Feature_Extraction Activity

This repository contains a notebook and scripts for text normalization and feature extraction.

Contents:
- `Feature Extraction/Paredes_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook that performs text cleaning (punctuation removal, spellcheck, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization) and extracts Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF features.
- `.gitignore` — updated to ignore the `Text Extraction/` folder.

Notes:
- The dataset `Fin_lab-PRProject_dataset.csv` is present locally; consider not pushing large datasets to GitHub.
- If you want me to push the dataset as well, tell me and I'll include it (not recommended for large files).
